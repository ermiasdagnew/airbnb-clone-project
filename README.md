## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to manage users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. It follows a relational structure to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

### **Entities and Their Fields**

#### 1. Users
- **id**: unique identifier for each user  
- **name**: full name of the user  
- **email**: user’s email address (must be unique)  
- **password**: hashed password for security  
- **role**: defines if the user is a host or guest  

#### 2. Properties
- **id**: unique identifier for each property  
- **title**: short name or title of the listing  
- **description**: detailed information about the property  
- **location**: city or area where the property is located  
- **price_per_night**: rental cost per night  
- **host_id**: references the user who owns the property  

#### 3. Bookings
- **id**: unique identifier for each booking  
- **user_id**: references the user making the booking  
- **property_id**: references the booked property  
- **check_in**: start date of the stay  
- **check_out**: end date of the stay  
- **status**: booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)  

#### 4. Payments
- **id**: unique identifier for each payment  
- **booking_id**: references the related booking  
- **amount**: total amount paid  
- **payment_date**: date of payment  
- **payment_method**: e.g., credit card, PayPal  

#### 5. Reviews
- **id**: unique identifier for each review  
- **user_id**: references the user who wrote the review  
- **property_id**: references the reviewed property  
- **rating**: numerical rating (1–5 stars)  
- **comment**: optional text feedback

### **Entity Relationships**

- A **User** can list **multiple Properties** (1-to-many).  
- A **Property** can have **many Bookings** (1-to-many).  
- A **Booking** is associated with **one Payment** (1-to-1).  
- A **User** can make **many Bookings** (1-to-many).  
- A **Property** can have **many Reviews**, and a **User** can write **many Reviews** (many-to-many relationship handled through the Reviews table).

✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes key features that enable users to interact with the platform just like in a real-world booking system. Each feature plays an important role in delivering a complete and seamless user experience.
1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
It ensures only authenticated users can access certain features, protecting user data and privacy.
2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with details like location, price, and amenities.
This feature forms the core of the platform, connecting users to available accommodations.
3. Booking System
Users can book properties for specific dates, view their upcoming bookings, and manage check-ins/check-outs.
It ensures accurate availability and prevents double bookings.
4. Payment Processing
Integrates payment functionality so users can complete transactions securely.
It records payment details, updates booking status, and ensures smooth financial operations.
5. Review and Rating System
Allows users to leave feedback and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in.
This helps maintain trust and transparency within the platform.
6. Data Optimization
Implements caching and indexing for faster data retrieval and better performance.
It enhances user experience by reducing response times during searches and bookings.

🔒 API Security
Security is a core part of the Airbnb Clone backend architecture. Since the platform handles sensitive information such as user credentials, booking details, and payment data, multiple security measures will be implemented to ensure data integrity and privacy.
1. Authentication
Only registered and verified users can access protected endpoints.
We’ll use secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Authorization
Different roles (e.g., admin, host, user) will have distinct permissions.
Role-based access control ensures users can only perform actions that align with their roles — for example, only property owners can edit their listings.
3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted using modern algorithms like bcrypt and SSL/TLS.
This prevents data theft during transmission and storage.
4. Rate Limiting
Implements limits on the number of API requests per user to prevent DDoS attacks and brute-force attempts.
This keeps the platform stable and responsive for all users.
5. Input Validation and Sanitization
All user input will be validated and sanitized to protect against SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection attacks.
Ensures that only safe and properly formatted data enters the system.
6. Secure Payment Handling
Payment APIs will follow PCI-DSS compliance standards.
Sensitive transaction data will be processed through secure payment gateways to maintain trust and integrity.
7. Regular Security Audits
The backend will include periodic vulnerability scans and dependency updates.
This ensures that security standards are maintained as the project evolves.
